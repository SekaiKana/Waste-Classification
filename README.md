# Waste-Classification

# 🧠 Deep Learning Image Classification

This project is a hands-on exploration of **deep learning for image classification** using **TensorFlow/Keras**.  
The notebook demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate CNNs and transfer learning models on image datasets.  

✨ The main goals are:
- Preprocess images for training/testing
- Experiment with **custom CNNs** and **pre-trained models** (VGG16, InceptionV3)
- Use **callbacks** like Early Stopping & Model Checkpointing
- Evaluate model performance with **metrics & visualizations**
- Learn how to adapt transfer learning to new classification problems

---

## 📊 Example Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Load images with `ImageDataGenerator`  
   - Apply real-time augmentation (rotation, zoom, flips, shifts)  

2. **Model Building**  
   - Custom CNNs with Conv2D, MaxPooling, Flatten, Dense, Dropout layers  
   - Transfer Learning with **VGG16** and **InceptionV3**  

3. **Training**  
   - Optimizers (Adam, SGD, RMSprop)  
   - Callbacks for learning rate scheduling & checkpoints  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Classification reports (`scikit-learn`)  
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
   - Training/validation curves plotted with Matplotlib
